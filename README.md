####Twendy is a visual application that present global Twitter trends in the last 24 hours

#####Twitter users send more than 95 million Tweets a day, on just about every topic imaginable. This is quite a lot to handle!
In order to better understand about what is the most interesting topic people are tweeting about, Twitter desided to track the volume of terms mentioned by its users on an ongoing basic and turn them into topics. When the volume of tweets about a given topic dramatically increases at a given moment, a Trend will be born!
Since Twitter Trend represent topics that are being talked about more right now than they were previously, we decided to feel the world's pulse by building an application that will give an easy access to all those trends that happening around our world at a given time.
#####We choose to serve this data on a globe, divided to countries, while clicking on a specific country will pop-up its 10 most recent trends and track them in the last 24 hours. Twitter currently tracking 62 countries but we program our code to graw along when Twitter decide to add more countries to its list.

#####How to use Twendy?
#####Drag the globe to your desired country and click it! A pop-up window will come up with the country's 10 hottest trends and their appearance in the last 24 hours. The trend's popularity is being represented by a heat-map table where the hottest trend has a red colour and the least with blue. Plain and easy!
Get impressed with what trendy right now in every country and when you like to return to the whole globe state, just click the same country you clicked before (as it mark with orange colour).

#####Test Driven Development
I am a big fun of testing and strongly believe that every application should contain testing units.
As a result, Twendy is well tested on the server side with 100% covarage.
