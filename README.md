####Twendy is a visual application of a global Twitter trends in the last 24 hours

####Twitter users send more than 95 million Tweets a day, on just about every topic imaginable. This is quite a lot to handle!
####In order to better understand about what is the most interesting topic people are twitting about, Twitter deside to track the volume of terms mentioned by its users on an ongoing basic and turn them into topics. When the volume of tweets about a given topic dramatically increases at a given moment, a Trend has been born!
####Since Twitter Trend represent topics that are being talked about more right now than they were previously we decided to feel the world's pulse by building an application that will give an easy access to all those trends that happening around our world at a given time.
####We choose to serve these data on a globe that will give access to each country Twitter tracking right now (their are currently 62 countries but our application can graw along with Twitter)
